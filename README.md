### Sunflower
Sunflower is an open-source, plugin-driven system designed for binary analysis. Was inspired by Ghidraâ€™s internals.
This is a extensible Binary Analysis and Recognition Framework

All core plugins moved from JellyBins

### Sunflower seeds (application plugins)

1) Create Visual Studio solution.
2) Add reference `SunFlower.Abstractions.dll`
3) Make sure: no differences between Client app version and Abstractions
4) Follow this template

```csharp
public class MyAnalyzer : IFlowerSeed {
  /// Title
  public string Name => "It shows in Connected Plugins menu";
  /// Plugin results writes here. All exception chains
  /// contains here. When exception throws -> 
  /// plugin terminates and information shows in a Client app.
  public FlowerSeedStatus Status { get; set; }
  /// EntryPoint 
  /// (calls when IFlowerSeed derivate instance creates)
  public int Main(string path) { /* Scan for patterns */ }
}
```

If you want use F# toolchain you can implement it like this:

```fsharp
type MyAnalyzer() =
  interface IFlowerSeed with
  /// Title
  member this.Name = "It shows in Connected Plugins menu"
  /// Plugin results writes here. All exception chains
  /// contains here. When exception throws -> 
  /// plugin terminates and information shows in a Client app.
  member val Status = FlowerSeedStatus() with get, set
  /// EntryPoint
  /// (calls when IFlowerSeed derivate instance creates)
  member this.Main(path: string) : int = 
    // Scan for patterns
    0
```

5) Build and Drop .DLL into `%Application%/Plugins`

### An architecture problems that seriously bother me, but I can't fix them

 - Stupid Exceptions handling -
A `Main` procedure contains exceptions handler which
rewrites Status last error field. Loader prints this message with `--- Begin/End Exception chain ---` brakets.
 - Versions incompatibility - Unfortunately Sunflower plugins which are differ the foundation are **incompatible** at the moment of updating documentation.
Any differences between foundation file version and plugins foundation calls force exit (means conflict behaviour).
